        <h2>About the class</h2>
        <p>Being in a Full-Stack Web Dev class, we are going to be merging techniques from front-end and back-end while
            learning more about topics such as ORM, MVC and continuing understanding how website works on mobile
            devices. </p>
        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p>My name is Philip Le, I don't really go by anything else, and I don't mind other names also. At the moment,
            I'm
            in my 4th year and I'm doing Co-Terminal this semester including this class! When it comes to experience, I
            really only have last years web development class as experience so I'm not and expert by any means, but I'm
            still in an eager leaning phase!</p>
        <h3>Other things about me</h3>
        <p>I am currently an ITM Major with a specialization in Web Design.</p>
        <p>I'm apart of the Volleyball Club for a year now and would love if other people would join as well!</p>
        <p>In free time, I'm usually messing around with games, Photoshop, and Premier Pro (although I'm just an
            amateur).
        </p>
        <p>I'm a bit of a Tetris enthusiast.</p>
