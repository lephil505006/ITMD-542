Repo Link: https://github.com/lephil505006/ITMD-542/tree/main/Lab3

Project Description: This project is a copy of Lab2 using SQLite for a database

Development Environment: Windows 10, Node JS v18.14.0, Visual Studio Code

***IMPORTANT Installation Instructions: I've tested this one on my surface so this information isn't entirely consistent but:
1. Assuming you download the Lab2 portion from the repository, you will want to open an editor with that.
2. Make sure to have node js updated as well.
3. Using to terminal in Visual Studio, make sure you are in "/Lab3"
4. You will want to use the code "npm run dev"
5. Once it runs successfully, you will go on your web browser and type in "localhost:3000" in the url.
6. If all checks out, the app should run successfully!

****NOTE FOR ERROR: Currently, this isn't able to run die to an TypeError.
